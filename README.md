MensaBot+
=========
MensaBot+ is the successor of a small prototype. The idea for MensaBot starts in my first working days. I was always annoyed that I don't know which meals the university canteen called 'mensa' was offering.

First Start
--------------
Create `config.json`, use `config_example.json` as template and modify at least email settings.
You can now start mensabot with
```
./mensabot.py
```

If you want to run the web-interface you can start:
```
./web.py
```

In the default settings the web-interface is aviable via [http://localhost:4223](http://localhost:4223)
